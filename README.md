# StrokeEngine
A DX12 NPR style rendering practice with CS outline painting and deferred rendering.
Enging: Engine dll creator (DX12) 
StrikeEngine: QT UI
StrikeEngine/FBXResouce: FBXinput files
StrikeEngine/Shaders: Shaders files

This Engine can change effect bases on material, so it allow different part of a FBX have different outline.

I don't think it's easy to rebuild, so for now just for reference.
Beside, many fundamental codes are examples of《Introduction to 3D Game Programming with Directx12》.
